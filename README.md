## 👋 Hi, I'm Travis DeShazo

🚀 **Laboratory/Industrial Software Engineer | Embedded Systems Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner**

> *Hey!* My day job lives behind corporate firewalls, so you won’t see what I do professionally here. This account showcases my **personal projects, experiments, and hobbies** (i.e., the things I build at 5am with coffee or after the kids are asleep.)

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools  

- **Languages**: Python, C#, C/C++, VBA, SQL, Go
- **Frameworks & Tools**: .NET, PyQt, PlatformIO, Arduino, CircuitPython
- **Databases**: SQL Server, Oracle, SQLite, Postgres
- **Hardware**: AVR/Arduino, ESP32, RP2040/2350, Raspberry Pi, 3D printing

### How I work (values)

* **Pragmatic > perfect.** Ship something small; iterate.
* **User-centric.** Tools should remove friction, not add it.
* **Transparent.** Clear READMEs, visible trade-offs, honest limits.
* **Collaborative.** I like crossing silos and connecting dots, though more often than not I'm a lone-wolf (looking to change that!)
* **Always learning.** I'm always looing for opportunities to grow, improve, and do cool stuff.

### Connect

* **Issues/Discussions:** Best way to reach me is to open an issue on any repo.
* **LinkedIn:** https://linkedin.com/in/travisdeshazo
